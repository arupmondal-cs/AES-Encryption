## Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Encryption Scheme

.NET provides high level classes for various encryption algorithms, both symmetric and asymmetric. [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) is one of the symmetric encryption algorithms that allows both parties, sender and receiver, to use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data.

The **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**, also known by its original name **Rijndael** is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.

AES is a subset of the Rijndael block cipher  developed by two Belgian cryptographers, **Vincent Rijmen** and **Joan Daemen**, who submitted a proposal to NIST during the AES selection process. Rijndael is a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes.

AES is based on a design principle known as a **substitutionâ€“permutation network**, and is efficient in both software and hardware. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a **Feistel network**. AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed **block size** of 128 bits, and a **key size** of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, Rijndael per se is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.


## File Descriptions

The following steps describe the AES encyption scheme,

#### Step 1

```
AESClass
```

This class contains the **Main()** function which manages the AES encryption scheme.

#### Step 2

```
Aes myAes = Aes.Create()
```

Creates a cryptographic object that specifies the implementation of AES to use to perform the symmetric algorithm.

#### Step 3

```
byte[] encrypted = EncryptStringToBytes_Aes(message, myAes.Key, myAes.IV)
```

**EncryptStringToBytes_Aes** encryption function, which takes three inputs,

  * **message** plaintext that you want to encrypt
  * **myAes.Key** and **myAes.IV** : a new instance of the Aes class. This generates a new key and initialization vector         (IV).
  
#### Step 4

```
string Final = DecryptStringFromBytes_Aes(encrypted, myAes.Key, myAes.IV)
```

**DecryptStringFromBytes_Aes** decryption function which takes same **key** and **IV** for decrypt the message.


## Compile and Run
  
  Writing C# Programs on Linux:
  
  Mono is an open-source version of the .NET Framework which includes a C# compiler and runs on several operating systems, including various flavors of Linux and Mac OS. Check for [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).
  
  To Compile:
  
  ```
  $ mcs AES.cs
  ```
  
  The compiler will create **"AES.exe"**, which you can run using:
  
  ```
  $ mono AES.exe
  ```
  
  
  ## Execution with Pictures
  
  The output looks like the following where you can type any text that will be encrypted and decrypted.
